# ThumbHash Python

A very quick Python port of [Evan Wallace's](https://github.com/evanw) [ThumbHash](https://github.com/evanw/thumbhash).

For now only supports encoding images.

## Disclaimer

If you want to use this code in your project, please fork it and maintain your own version. While it works for me, I
can't promise that it is bug free and I will maintain it in the future.
But feel free to use this code as a starting point for your own port.

Also keep in mind that this implementation is far for optimal and quite slow (~60ms), which should nevertheless be fast
enough for most use cases.
